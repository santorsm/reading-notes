# Reading and Writing Files in Python

## File Paths

- a string that represents the location of a file
- 3 parts:
  **1.** **Folder Path:** the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
  **2.** **File Name:** the actual name of the file
  **3.** **Extension:** the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type
- _Current Working Directory_ (cwd)
- _double-dot (..)_ - to move one directory up
- chained together to traverse multiple directories above the current directory

## Line Endings

- Carriage Return (CR or \r) _and_ the Line Feed (LF or \n) characters (CR+LF or \r\n)
- ISO standard either the CR+LF characters or just the LF character
- Windows - CR+LF or
  \r\n
- Unix and the newer Mac versions use just the LF character (\n)
- parsing a file with the incorrect character encoding can lead to failures or misrepresentation of the character

## Opening & Closing a File in Python

- `open( )`
- single required argument that is the path to the file
- `file = open(‘dog_breeds.txt’)`
- two ways to close:
- `try-finally`

```python
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    reader.close()

```

- recommedned: `with`
  - automatically closes file:

```python
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
```

- second argument:

  - `r` - opening reading
  - `w` - opening for writing
  - `’rb’ or ‘wb’` - binary mode

## Reading and Writing Opened Files

`read(size=-1)`

- This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes
- If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read

`readline(size=-1)`

- This reads at most size number of characters from the line
- This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around
- If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read

`readline`

- This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list

## Iterating Over Each Line in the File

```python
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read and print the entire file line by line
>>>     line = reader.readline()
>>>     while line != '':  # The EOF char is an empty string
>>>         print(line, end='')
>>>         line = reader.readline()

>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     for line in reader.readlines():
>>>         print(line, end='')

>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read and print the entire file line by line
>>>     for line in reader:
>>>         print(line, end='')

Output

Pug
Jack Russell Terrier
English Springer Spaniel
German Shepherd
Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Golden Retriever
West Highland White Terrier
Boxer
Border Terrier

```

- `.write(string)` - writes the string to the file
- `.writelines(seq)` - writes the sequence to the file
- No line endings are appended to each sequence item
- It’s up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s)

## Don’t Re-Invent the Snake

- Two common file types you may need to work with are .csv and .json

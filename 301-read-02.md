# Read: 02 - jQuery, Events, and The DOM

## jQuery

- simple
- achieves a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently
- across all major browsers
- no  fallback code needed
- Specifically, jQuery
  - selects elements
  - performs tasks
  - handles events

- what is jQuery?
  - jQuery is a javascript file that is included in your web pages
  - it let's you find elements using CSS-style selectors, and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods
  - why use it:
    - simple selectors
    - common stasks, less code
    - compatable cross-browser
    - "write less, do more"
- include jQuery in `<script src="js/jquery3.0.js">`
- jQuery object `$('li.hot).method`
- *Finding Elements on pg.302*
- Able to update multiple elements using a single method

**Chaining** - The process of placing several methods in the same selector
- list several methods at a time using dot notation to separate each one
- It results in code that is far more compact

**Getting at Content**

- `.text`: gets content only 
- `.html`: content + html code within.

### Adding content:

before => `.append`, after=> `.preappend`

### Updating elements:

- `.text` & `.html` use `.replacewith`, `.remove`

Inseting content:

1. Create the new elements in a jQuery object
2. Use a method to insert the content into the page. .append.., etc.

- Getting and setting attribute values:
`.attr(), .removeAttr(), .addClass(), .removeClass`

- Getting and setting CSS properties:`.css()`


## Pair Programming (PP)

- a technique used to foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills
- used commonly in many agile work environments 
- involves two roles:

**Driver** the programmer typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard

- Manages the text editor, switching files, version control, writing—code

**Navigator** guides the Driver with words but does *not* provide any direct input to the computer

PP touches on all four skills

- speaking, listening, reading and writing
- forces developers to explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves

- its benefits include Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, ob interview readiness, work environment readiness

## [How to use the Random Module in Python](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)

### Randint

generates a random integer
Randit accepts two parameters the range: lowest and highest number

- 0 < x <= 5

```python
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
```

This will output 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

### Random

Multiply for larger #

```python
import random
random.random() * 100
```

### Choice

- generate a random value from the sequence
- can be used for choosing a random element from a list

```python
import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)
```

### Shuffle

shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order

```python
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
```

### Randrange

Generate a randomly selected element from `range(start, stop, step)`

```python
random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```

## Why is Risk Analysis in Software Testing?

### Why use Risk Analysis?

Highlights the potential problem areas
Helps mitigate the risks

A list of possible risks:

1. Use of new hardware
2. Use of new technology
3. Use of new automation tool
4. The sequence of code
5. Availability of test resources for the application

Unavoidable risks:

- Time allocated for testing
- A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
- Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
- Incomplete requirements

### Risk Identification

1. **Business Risks:** The most common risk associated with our topic

- risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project

2. **Testing Risks:** You should be well acquainted with the platform you're working on, along with the software testing tools being used

3. **Premature Release Risk:** a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software

4. **Software Risks:** be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process

### Risk Assessment

1. Early forecast of unwanted situationin your project
2. Estimating potential loss of such situation
3. Making decision to deal with such situation
4. Avoid the future consequences

### The perspective of Risk Assessment

**Effect** – To assess risk by Effect
In case you identify a condition, event, or action and try to determine its impact

**Cause** – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect
Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that

**Likelihood** – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied

### How to perform Risk Analysis?

There are three steps:

1. Searching the risk

2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3. Measures for the risk identified

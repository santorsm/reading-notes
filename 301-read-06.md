## Node

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime, uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library

It's built on Google's Chrome V8 JS Engine

- The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine
  - runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers
  - compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute

Does **NOT** mean that Node programs are executed in a browser - They are not

_V8 engine_ enhanced with various features, such as - a file system API, an HTTP library,a number of operating system–related utility methods

- it’s a JavaScript runtime executing JavaScript on our computers
- **repl** - read, eval, print, loop
- **npm** - node package manager that comes with Node. Makes it easy to find dependancies

- check that Node is installed on your system => `node -v`
- great compatability and support with latest and most modern JS syntax
- generally don't have to worry about compatibility issues that you would with JS
  - `npm init` - can be used to create file
    - `package.json` - tells npm how your package is structured and and what to do to install it
    - lists all dependencies as well
- Node.js capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections

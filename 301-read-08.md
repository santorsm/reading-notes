# Web API Design

A well-designed web API should aim to support:
- *Platform independence*: Any client should be able to call the API, regardless of how the API is implemented internally
- *Service evolution*: evolve and add functionality independently from client applications

## Representational State Transfer (REST)

REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia

Design principles include:

- REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client
- A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource
- Clients interact with a service by exchanging representations of resources
  - Many web APIs use JSON as the exchange format
- REST APIs use a uniform interface, which helps to decouple the client and service implementations
  - For REST APIs built on HTTP, he most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
- When possible, resource URIs should be based on *nouns (the resource)* and not *verbs (the operations on the resource)*

## Define operations in terms of HTTP methods

`GET` retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource  

`POST` creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource

    - Note `POST` can also be used to trigger operations that donâ€™t actually create resources  

`PUT` either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.

`PATCH` performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.

`DELETE` removes the resource at the specified URI.

- differences between POST, PUT, and PATCH
  - A `POST` request creates a resource
  - A `PUT` request creates a resource or updates an existing resource
    - The request body contains a complete representation of the resource
  - A `PATCH` request performs a partial update to an existing resource
    - The request body specifies a set of changes to apply to the resource, not the entire representation of the resource

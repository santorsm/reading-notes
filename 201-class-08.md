# Layout

## Highlights

- `<div>` used as containing elements to group together sections of a page
- Browsers display pages in *normal flow* unless you specify **relative, absolute, or fixed positioning**
- **float** moves content left or right
  - create multi-column layouts
- pages either: **fixed width or liquid layouts
- Designer width: *960-1000 pixels*
- Designer height: indicate what the site is about using the top 600
- **Grids** = flexibe designs
- **CSS Frameworks** = rules for common tasks
- Multiple CSS files per page is ok!

### Block-level elements

- start on a new line
- Examples include: `<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`

### Inline elements

- flow in Between surrounding text
- Examples include `<img> <b> <i>`

### Containing elements

- A box may be nested inside several other block-level elements
- The containing element is always the direct parent of that element

## Positioning schemes

### normal flow

- Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one
- Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-by- side, they will not appear next to each other

### relative positioning

- This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed
- This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in in normal flow

### absolute positioning

- This positions the element
in relation to its containing element
- It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up)- - Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page

### fixed positioning

- This is a form of absolute positioning that positions
the element in relation to the *browser window*, as opposed to the *containing element*

### floating element

- Floating an element allows you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a containing box
- The floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow

- Note: When you move
any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The `z-index` property allows you to control which box appears on top

`clear` = no element (within the same containing element) should touch the left or right- hand sides of a box

**Fixed width layout designs** do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window

- Measurements tend to be given in pixels

**Liquid layout designs** stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window

- They tend to use percentages

### CSS Frameworks

- one of most popular is creating **grids** to layou pages
  - creates correct width for the columns & sets spaces between
  - The only rules we need to add are:
    - Control the font and the position of the text in the boxes
    - Set the height of the feature and article boxes
    - Add a margin to the top and bottom of each box

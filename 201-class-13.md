# Reading 13: Local Storage

Source: [THE PAST, PRESENT, and FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html)

The problem HTML5 set out to solve: to provide a standardized API, implemented natively and consistently in multiple browsers, without having to rely on third-party plugins

## HTML5 Storage

- a specification named Web Storage
- Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage”
- a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser
- data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you
  - never transmitted to the remote web server
- you’ll access HTML5 Storage through the `localStorage` object on the `global window` object
- how to check for HTML5 Storage

```js
function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

- can use Mondernizer to detect support for HTML5

```js
if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}
```

## Using HTML5 Storage

- HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs
  - named key is a string
  - The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats
- If storing and retrieving anything other than strings need to use `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()`
  - coerces retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype

```js
interface Storage {
  getter any getItem(in DOMString key);
  setter creator void setItem(in DOMString key, in any data);
};
```
- `setItem()` - with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value

- `getItem()` - with a non-existent key will return null rather than throw an exception

- you can treat the `localStorage` object as an associative array
- Instead of using the `getItem()` and `setItem()` methods, you can simply use square brackets `[]`

```js

var foo = localStorage.getItem("bar");
// ...
localStorage.setItem("bar", foo);

```
can be written as:

```js

var foo = localStorage["bar"];
// ...
localStorage["bar"] = foo;

```

## TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE AREA

- use `storage` to keep track programatically of when the storage area changes
- fired on the window object whenever `setItem()`, `removeItem()`, or `clear()` is called and actually changes something
- `handle_storage` callback function will be called with a `StorageEvent` object
  - properties of `StorageEvent` object include:
    - `key`: the named key that was added, removed, or modified
    - `oldValue`: the previous value (now overwritten), or null if a new item was added
    - `newValue`: the new value, or null if an item was removed
    - `url`: the page which called a method that triggered this change

## HTML5 STORAGE IN ACTION

- with HTML5 Storage, we can save the progress locally
  - Every time a change occurs within the game, we call this function:

  ```js
  function saveGameState() {
    if (!supportsLocalStorage()) { return false; }
    localStorage["halma.game.in.progress"] = gGameInProgress;
    for (var i = 0; i < kNumPieces; i++) {
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".row"] = gPieces[i].row;
	localStorage["halma.piece." + i + ".column"] = gPieces[i].column;
    }
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiece"] = gSelectedPieceIndex;
    localStorage["halma.selectedpiecehasmoved"] = gSelectedPieceHasMoved;
    localStorage["halma.movecount"] = gMoveCount;
    return true;
}
```

**Data is stored as strings. If you are storing something other than a string, you’ll need to coerce it yourself when you retrieve it**

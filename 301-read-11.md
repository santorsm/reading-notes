# EJS

* EJS a server-side templating library
  * still using Javascript
  * it allows for:
     a fast development time,
     simple syntax,
     quick execution
     easy debugging of Javascript errors
* EJS is for the backend, just as mustache and jquery were for the frontend
* Instead of a static index.html, EJS allows us to dynamically build the HTML
* __install__: `$ npm install ejs`

## The setup

Templating would take place inside a `views` folder and these are the files needed to get started:

```html
- views
----- partials
---------- footer.ejs
---------- head.ejs
---------- header.ejs
----- pages
---------- index.ejs
---------- about.ejs
- package.json
- server.js
```

`package.json` will hold Node info and the necessary dependencies (express and EJS)     `server.js` for express server setup, configuration, and routes to pages

## Some EJS tags

`<%` 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output  
`<%=` Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)

Not to print as text, leave off the equal `"="` within the `<% %>`  
To print as text: `<%= %>`

## EJS Basics

### Inject value into EJS view and evaluate that value

* On the `server.js` create a variable in the `app.get('/'...)`
* In the ejs file add `<%= variable_here %>` to insert the variable
* The `=` equals sign means it is going to evaluate a variable

### Iterate over an array value

Write the array on `server.js` file in the `app.get` people - in this instance
And the unordered list on the `ejs` file

```js
<ul>

<% for(let person of people) { %>
<li><%= person.name %></li>
<% } %>

</ul>
```

### Use If/Else Statement

Same people array as above on the `server.js`  if/else statement in the `index.ejs` file

```js
<ul>

<% for(var person of people) { %>

<% if(person.name === 'dave') { %>

<li>This is definitely <%= person.name %>!!!</li>

<% } else { %>

<li>This is definitely not dave!!! This is <%= person.name</li>

<% } %>
<% } %>

</ul>
```

### EJS Partials

* used when you want to use the same HTML multiple times in multiple views
* collection of code is defined in a file, and then used wherever needed

* reusable text that remains static
  * footers
  * Nav bars

### The Overview of making partials

* Create a file for the HTML containing the specific portion of the page such as the nav bar
Repeat for any other section to be repeated across the website, ie the footer
The file extension for these files will be `.ejs` (`navbar.ejs`)

### The Syntax for making Partials

* Any JS or non-HTML syntax is in templates surrounded by `<% %>` delimiters
* To add a partial: `<%- include(PARTIAL_FILE)%>`
* Example: on the `views/home.ejs` file, write `<%- include('partials/navbar') %>` wherever you want a navbar
* directs ejs to the partials directory and look for the navbar file
* the `navbar.ejs` file can be used multiple times in various places

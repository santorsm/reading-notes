 # Passing Functions as Props

 ## Lifting State Up

 - when several components need to reflect the same changing data
 - lift shared state up to closest common ancestor
 - common ancestor becomes "source of truth" for the inputs and keep them consistant with each other
 - instead of trying to sync the state between different components rely on top-down data flow
 - Since any state “lives” in some component and that component alone can change it, the surface area for bugs is greatly reduced
- if something can be derived from either props or state, it probably shouldn’t be in the state
  - For example, instead of storing both `celsiusValue` and `fahrenheitValue`, we store just the last edited temperature and its scale. The value of the other input can always be calculated from them in the `render()` method. This lets us clear or apply rounding to the other field without losing any precision in the user input

## Lists and Keys

- transforming list in JS

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

- build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces `{}`
- example:
 
```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
```

- `listItems` included in `<ul>` element `<ul>{listItems}</ul>`

## Basic List Component

- render list inside a component

```jsx
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
);
```

## Keys

- help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
- should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);
```

- use a string that uniquely identifies as a list item among its siblings
  - most oftern use IDs from your data as keys
- use item index as a last resort

```jsx
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
  // Only do this if items have no stable IDs
  <li key={index}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```

- We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change

## Extracting Components with Keys

- keys only make sense in the surrounding array

```jsx
function ListItem(props) {
  // Correct! There is no need to specify the key here:
  return <li>{props.value}</li>;
}

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array.
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />

```

- **A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys**

- Keys used *within* arrays should be unique among their *siblings*. However they don’t need to be *globally* unique
- embedding any expression in curly braces:

```jsx
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) =>
        <ListItem key={number.toString()}
                  value={number} />
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## The spread operator

- from [How to use the Spread Operator (...) in JavaScript](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

- ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments
- The spread syntax “spreads” the array into separate arguments
- useful for:  
  - Copying an array
  - Concatenating or combining arrays
  - Using Math functions
  - Using an array as arguments
  - Adding an item to a list
  - [Adding to state in React](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-add-to-an-array-in-react-state-3d08ddb2e1dc)
  - Combining objects
  - Converting NodeList to an array

- creates a new reference to its primitive values copying them
  - changes to original array will not affect the copied array

### SQL vs NoSQL: High Level Differences

| SQL | NoSQL |
| :-----------: | :------------: |
| Primarily called as relational Database (RDBMS)|Primarily called as **non**-relational or distributed database |
| Table-based database | Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| Have predefined schema | Have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Good fit for complex query intensive environment | Not a good fit for complex queries - doesn't have standard interfaces to perform them, the queries are not as powerful |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Highly structured data and associations are clearly defined

## Give a real world example.
customer orders and product records

## What kind of data is a good fit for an NoSQL database?
If data is highly unstructured and relationships between entities not clearly defined

## Give a real world example.
Geo-spatial information, and satellite data
data from social media analysis and websites

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL - Fits better for hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. 

## Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL.  SQL-based databases undergo vertical scaling, which is extremely costly
NoSQL scales horizontally and scalability issues can easily be handled by adding another node in a database cluster. Its highly preferred for large database

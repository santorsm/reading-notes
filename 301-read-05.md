# Thinking in React

## Break the UI into a Component Hierarchy

- draw boxes around every component & subcomponent
  - give them names
- *single responsibility principle* - a component should ideally only do one thing
  - if it grows break it into subcomponents
- UI and dat models adhere to same *information architecture* - where each component matches one piece of your data model
- identify then arrange into a hierarchy

## Build a static version in React

- Build a version that takes data model but no interactivity
- pass data from parent to child using props
- **Dont use state at all** to build this static version - reserved for interactivity (data changes over time)
- ending wit a library of reusable components

## Identify the minimal (but complete) representation of UI state

- trigger changes to underlying data model with **state**
- think of the minimal set of mutable states that the app needs
- *DRY: Dont Repeat Yourself* - think of absolute minimal & do others on-demand
- Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state
  - Ask three questions about each piece of data
    1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
    2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
    3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

## Identify where your state should live
  
  - identify which component mutates or owns state
  - React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy
    - it may not be clear which component should own what state

For each piece of state in your application:

1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state

2. Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy)

3. Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state

4. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component

## Add inverse data flow

- support the data flowing the *other* way: the components deep in the heirarchy need to update the state at the top
- React amkes this data flow explicit
- since components should only update their own state, `App.js` will pass callbacks to the child that will fire whenever the state should be updated
  - use `onChange` events onthe inputs
  - the callbacks will call `setState()` and the app will be updated

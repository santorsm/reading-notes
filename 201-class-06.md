# Chapter 3: “Object Literals

## Object:
 - Group together a set of variables functions to create a model of somethin you'd recognize in the real world
 ### In an Object:
 - variables --> properties
 - functions --> methods
   - represent tasks associated with the object
   - use `this` when referencing method w/in object
- **Cannot** have two keys with same name
-  setup:

      var `objectname` = {`key`: `value`,
      };

### How to access
- access properties or methods use dot notationor square brackets

var `hotelName` = `hotel.name`;

var `hotelName` = `hotel['name']`

# Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” or DOM

## DOM -
 specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page & how JavaScript can access and update while in browser window
 - uses **DOM Tree** to model webpage
   - each represents a different part of the browswer window
   - identifies methods and properties to to access and update each object --> updates what user sees in the browser
   - states what your script can ask the browser about the current page

  - parent element
  - what you  see in the browswer is an *OBJECT*
  - can be **called** by a method 
  - pattern: 
     1. access element
        ### select and indvidual element node
         - `getElementByld()`: uses of an element's ``id``
         - `querySe1ector()`: uses CSS selector and returns *first* matching element

        ### select multiple elements (nodelist)
        - `getElementsByClassName()`: select all elements that have specific values for their class attributes
        - `getElementsByTagName()`: selects all elements that have specified tag name
        - `querySelectorAll()`:
        uses CSS selectorto select all matching elements

        ### traversing between element nodes

        - `parentNode`: selects parent of current element node
        - `previousSibling / nextSibling`:  selects previous or next sibling sibling
        - `firstChild / lastChild`: selects first or last child of the current element

     2. work within element / give it content
          ### Access / update Text Nodes
          - text inside any element is a text node:
            1. select `<li>` element
             2. use `firstChild` property to get to text node
            3. use `nodeValue` to get text from element

          ### Work with HTML content



     3. append to DOM

# Intro to React

## What Is React?

- React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”
- **React component class** or **React Component Type**:
  - takes in `props` (short for properties)
  - returns a hierarchy of views to display via the `render` method
    - The `render` method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen
    - In particular, `render` returns a **React element**, which is a lightweight description of what to render
  - written using **JSX**
    - JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript
    - You can put *any* JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX
  - Each **React element** is a JavaScript *object* that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program
  - Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently; this allows you to build complex UIs from simple components
  - Passing props is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children

## Hello World

The following prints "Hello, world!" on the page:
```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Introducing JSX

- JSX produced React "elements"
- React *separates concerns* with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both
- React doesn’t require using JSX 
  - most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code
  - It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages

## Embedding Expressions in JSX

- we declare a variable called `name` and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:
```js
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

- You can put **any** valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX

- In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, `formatName(user)`, into an `<h1>` element:

```js
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### JSX is an Expression Too

- After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects
- you can use JSX inside of `if` statements and `for` loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

```js
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```

### Specifying Attributes with JSX

- You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:

```js
const element = <div tabIndex="0"></div>;
```

- curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:

```js
const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>;
```
- Either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but **not both** in the same attribute

### Specifying Children with JSX

- If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with `/>`
- may contain children:

```js
const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
);
```

- JSX prevents injection attacks by escaping any values embedded inth JSX before rendering
  - can never inject anything not explicitly written in your application

  ### JSX Represents Objects

  - Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls:

  ```js
  const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
  );
is the same as:

```js
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

`React.createElement()` creates an object like this:
```js
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

- example of *React element* - descriptions of what you want them to see on the screen

### Rendering an Element into the DOM

```js
<div id="root"></div>
```

- a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM
  - Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node
  - integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like

- **To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():**

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Upating the Rendered Element

- React elements are **immutable**
  - once created cannot change its children or attributes
  - an element is like a single frame in a movie: *it represents the UI at a certain point in time*
- thus far the way to update the UI is to:  
  1. create a new element
  2. pass it to `ReactDOM.render()`

```js
  function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

- calls `ReactDOM.render()` every second from a `setInterval()` callback

### React Only Updates What's Necessary

- React DOM:
  - compares the element and its children to the previous one
  - only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state
- Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM
- thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs

## Components & Props

- *Components* let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation
  - akin to JavaScript functions
  - They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen

  ### Function and Class Components

  - JS function is easiest way to define a component

  ```js
  function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
  }
  ```

  -  it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element
  - “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions
- which is the same as:

```js 
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```
### Rendering a Component

- React elements that represent DOM tags:
```js
const element = <div />;
```

- elements can also represent user-defined components:

```js
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

- When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object *props*
- renders "Hello Sara" to the page:

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
**Recap**:

1. We call ReactDOM.render() with the `<Welcome name="Sara" />` element
2. React calls the Welcome component with `{name: 'Sara'} `as the props.
3. Our Welcome component returns a `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>` element as the result.
4. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match `<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>`.

**Always start component names with a capital letter**

- React treats lowercase as DOM tags
- Capital letter tells React  this represents a component

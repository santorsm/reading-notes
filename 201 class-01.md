# Class 01 Reading Notes

## HTML CSS

### Chap 1: Structure

- Big picture HTML

	- The opening `<html>` tag indicates that anything between it and a closing `</html>` tag is HTML code. 

	- The `<body>` tag indicates that anything between it and the closing `</body>` tag should be shown inside the main browser window. 

	- Words between  `<h1>` and `</h1>` are a main heading. 

	- The closing `</body>` tag indicates the end of what should appear in the main browser window

	- The closing `</html>`tag indicates that it is the end of the HTML code. 

	- the `<title>` lement are either shown in the top of the browser, or on the tab for that page 

## In summary
	- HTML pages are text documents. 
	- *Tags*(characters that sit inside angled brackets) give the meaning
		- often referred to as elements. 
		- usually in pairs: opening tag = start of a piece of content; the closing tag = the end
	- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. 
	- Attributes require a name and a value. 


# Chapter 8: Extra Markup
Several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a `DOCTYPE` declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML 

**Comments**:  `<!— —>`

## Attributes

**id** :  used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page
	- Every element on page can have own unique
	- start with letter or underscore *only*
	- important that no two elements on same page have same value for id attribute
**class** :  identify several element as being different from others on page
	- Element can belong to several classes
	- *class* names can be separated by a space

## Elements
**block** - always appear to start on a new line in the browser window
	- Ex: *`<h1>`* ,*`<p>`*,*`<ul>`*, *`<li>`*

**inline elements** - some always appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements
	- Ex: `<a>`,`<b>`,`<em>`,`<img>`

## Grouping
### Block
`<div>`: allows for grouping a set of elements together in one block-level box
	- example: contain all elements for the site header - logo & nav
 `id`or `class`attribute on the `<div> `element, can create
CSS style rules to indicate how much space the `<div>` element should occupy on the screen and change the appearance of all the elements contained within it.
	- moments after the closing `</div>` can be helpful 

### Inline
`<span>` element acts like an inline equivalent of the `<div>` element 
	- Used for:
		1.  a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text 
		2. Contain a number of inline elements 
	- Most common reason: control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS. 
## Escape Characters
	
  - some characters reserved by HTML
	- ex. left & right brackets
		- left angled bracket, you can use either `&lt`; or `&#60`
		- ampersand, you can use either `&amp`; or `&#38`
			- listed on pg 194


# Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout
HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure
	- Names of these elements indicate he kind of content they contain 
These new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple `<div>` elements)

## HTML5

### Header & Footers
	- Main `<header>` & `<footer>` at top/bottom of every site
	- Each individual  `<article>` and `<section>`element can also have its own to hold the `<header>` or `<footer>` information for that section within the page 
### Navigation
`<nav>`: contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation
### Article
`<article>`:acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone & potentially be syndicated
	- ex: individual article, blog post, or any other independent piece of content
	- can be nested inside each other
### Asides
`<aside>` has two purposes depending if its in an `<article>`element or not
	- when **inside**: should contain info about article but not essential to the articles overall meaning
	- when **outside**container for content related to entire page
### Sections
`<section>`- groups related content together
	- typically each `<section>`would have its own heading
	- may contain several `<article>` elements that have a comment purpose
### Sectioning
`<div>` - when there is no suitable element to group a set element
	- Anything that lies outside of the `<header>`, `<footer>`, or `<aside>` can be considered main content


# Chapter 18: Process & Design
	- know who your visitors are & why they are visiting
	- work out what information they need to achieve their goal quickly & effectively
		- How often will people visit
	- Now organize info into sections or pages
	- Wireframe to org information to go on each page
	- Visual hierarchy helps with communication
	- Size, color, and style can be used to to differentiate between pieces of info
	- Grouping to simply the info you are presenting



# Javascript 
## Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming

 **script** a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
	- instruct to computer solve the task programmatically. 
	- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
	- **Objects** - represent physical things, # of objects - **instance**
		- can have its own properties, events, methods
	- **Properties** - common characteristics - name value
	-  **events**- notification of an activity triggered with interaction
	-  **Methods**- represent how people interact with an Object in the real world
	- HTML used by web browsers to create a model of the web page
	- Elements create own node
	- `<HTML>`: *content* *layer*
		- provides structure & adds semantics
	- `{CSS}`:*Presentation* *Layer*
		- enhances HTML with rules on how HTML is presented
	- `javascript()`: *Behavior* *Layer*
		- change how page behaves & add interactivity
		- keep in separate files 
    - use `<script>` to inform browser that its coming across javascript
		- object.Method

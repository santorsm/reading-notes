# Here are my notes on [Mastering Markdown on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

__Markdown__ - a way to style text on the web
* syntax for styling all forms of writing on GitHub, text files & other platforms
* Includes formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, creating lists, etc
* Mostly just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in
* GitHub has its own flavor of Markdown

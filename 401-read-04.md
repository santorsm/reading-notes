# Classes and Objects & Thinking Recursively

## Classes & Objects

**Objects** an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity

- Objects get their variables and functions from _classes_

**Classes** a template to create your objects

to assign a _class_ to an _object_:

```python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
```

the variable `myobjectx` holds an object of the class `MyClass` that contains the variable and the function defined within the class called `MyClass`

Access the variable inside of the newly created object `myobjectx`

```python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable

```

output string 'blah':
`print(myobjectx.variable)`

```python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
myobjecty = MyClass()

myobjecty.variable = "yackity"

# Then print out both values
print(myobjectx.variable)
print(myobjecty.variable)

```

### Accessing Object Functions

```python
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()
```

### Example:

```python
# define the Vehicle class
class Vehicle:
    name = ""
    kind = "car"
    color = ""
    value = 100.00
    def description(self):
        desc_str = "%s is a %s %s worth $%.2f." % (self.name, self.color, self.kind, self.value)
        return desc_str

# your code goes here
car1 = Vehicle()
car1.name = "Fer"
car1.color = "red"
car1.kind = "convertible"
car1.value = 60000.00

car2 = Vehicle()
car2.name = "Jump"
car2.color = "blue"
car2.kind = "van"
car2.value = 10000.00

# test code
print(car1.description())
print(car2.description())
```

## Recursive Functions in Python

Definition:

- A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions
- The function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result
- made up of two parts: base case and recursive case

```python

def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)
```

- each recursive call adds a stack frame (containing its execution context) to the call stack until we reach the base case
- the stack begins to unwind as each call returns its results
- each recursive call has its own execution context; so you must:
  - [Thread](https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/) the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current callâ€™s execution context
  - Keep the state in [global scope](https://realpython.com/python-namespaces-scope/)

### Threading

```python
def sum_recursive(current_number, accumulated_sum):
    # Base case
    # Return the final state
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum

    # Recursive case
    # Thread the state through the recursive call
    else:
        return sum_recursive(current_number + 1, accumulated_sum + current_number)

# Pass the initial state
>>> sum_recursive(1, 0)
55
```

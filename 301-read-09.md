# Functional Programming

A programming paradigm
treats computation as the evaluation of mathmatical functions
avoids changing-state and mutable data

## Pure Functions

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
- impure function - uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function
 - reading files and random number generation
 - observable side effects include - modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference

 ### Pure functions benefits

 - easier to understand and test
 - function is isolated and cannot impact other part of system

## Immutability

- state cannot be changed after its created
- to change create a new object with a anew value
- with *recursion* we keep variables immutable

## Higher-order functions

- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as a result

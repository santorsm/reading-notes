# Error Handling & Debugging

- More likely to find the error in code if you understand execution contexts and stacks

- debugging is the process of finding errors
  - its a *deductive* process
- the console helps narrow down area in which the error is located
- attempt to handle anticipated errors gracefully using `try, catch, finally` statements

## Order of Execution

- The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run
- JS uses **execution contexts**
  - *Global Context* - code in the script that is not a function
  - only one global context on any page
  - *Function Context* - Code run with a function
    - each function has its own function context
  - The contexts correspond to the notion of *scope*
    _ **Global Scope**
    - If a variable is declared outside a function, it can be used anywhere because it has global scope
    - If you do not use the `var` keyword when creating a variable, it is placed in global scope
    - **Function-level Scope**
    - When a variable is declared within a function, it can only be used within that function. This is because it has function-level scope

    - *stacks*
    - when JS executes, it reads line-by-line

    - when calls some other code in order to do its job, the new task goes to the top of the pile of things to do

    - once new task performed moves back to the tak at hand
    - each new item added to the stack it creates a new execution context

    - The children can ask the parents for information in their variables
    - But the parents cannot get variables from their children
    - Each child will get the same answer from the same parent

    ## Error Objects

    - **`SyntaxError`** - incorrect use of of the rules of the language

    - usually due to typo
    - examples include:
      - MISMATCHING OR UNCLOSED QUOTES ----> `SyntaxError: Unexpected EOF`
      - MISSING CLOSING BRACKET ----> `SyntaxError : Expected token ')'`
      - MISSING COMMA IN ARRAY ----> `SyntaxError : Expected token ']'`
      - MALFORMED PROPERTY NAME ----> `Synt axError: Expected an identifier but found 'name' instead`

  - **`ReferenceError`** - variable not declared or is out of scope

    - exmaples include:
      - VA RIABLE IS UNDECLARED ----> ReferenceError: `Can't find variable: height`
      - NAMED FUNCTION IS UNDEFINED ---->
      ```
      ReferenceError: Can't find variable:
      randomFunction
      ```
  - **`TypeError`** - trying to use an object or method that doesn't exist

  - **`RangeError`** - call a function using numbers outside of its accepted range]

# Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)

## Status Codes based on CRUD methods

100’s = informational status codes

  the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client

200’s = success codes
  
  tell the client that its request was accepted

300’s = redirection codes

  tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore

400’s = client error codes

  all about invalid requests a client sent to a server

500’s = server error codes

indicate problems with overwhelmed or unreachable servers behind proxies, sometimes directly related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server

202 Accepted

- Often used for asynchronous processing
- tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future

308 Permanent Redirect

- tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore
- resource used to exist, but no longer does

204 No Content

- code for updates that don’t return data to the client

403 Forbidden

The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource

## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB

1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

- deployment will be to to something other than the local host

2. What is middleware?

- functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle
  - The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named `next`
- middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
  - Execute any code
  - Make changes to the request and the response objects
  - End the request-response cycle
  - Call the next middleware function in the stack

3. What does app.use(express.json()) do?

- middleware to deal with the (incoming) data (object) in the body of the request.

  - `express.json()` is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a *JSON Object*

4. What does the /:id mean in a route?

- a parameter in the route specifying the id of the desired resource

5. What is the difference beween `PUT` and `PATCH`?

- `PUT` creates a new resource or replaces the target resource with the one provided in request payload
- replaces a resource if it exists, or adds new if it doesn’t
- client needs to send a complete representation of the resource in the request body
  - **always** idempotent
- `PATCH` applies partial modifications to the target resource
- The body of a PATCH request can contains instructions to modify the target resource
- the resource *must* already exist on the server, as the server won’t create the resource
  - *can be* idempotent

6. How do you make a default value in a schema?

- key: { type: String, default: 'default' }

7. What does a 500 error status code mean?

- internal server error
- from a missing header field to an unreachable 3rd party service

8. What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

- 200 OK - tells client everything went well
  - not creating endpoint accessible endpoint
- 201 Created - signals backend-side resource creation
  - comes along with a `Location` header that defines the most specific URL for that newly created resource

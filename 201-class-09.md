## Forms

HTML forms give a set of elements to collect data from users

### Form control

- **Adding Text**

  - `Text input` (single-line)
  - `Password input`
  - `Text area` (multi-line)

- **making Choices**

  - `Radio buttons`
  - `Checkboxes`
  - `Drop-down boxes`

- **Submitting & Uploading**

- `Submit & Image buttons`
- `File upload`

- **Process - How Forms work**

    1. user completes form & presses button
    2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the use selected value
    3. The server processes the information using a programming language
      - may also store in database
    4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received

- Server needs to know which piece of data corresponds with which lelment
  - name/vale pairs send to server

### Form structure

- live with `<form>` element
- `<form>` element requires an `action` attribute
- sent using two `methods`: `get` or `post`

### Chapter 14 Lists, Tables, and Forms

- In addition to the CSS properties there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms

- List markers can be given different appearances using the `list-style-type` and `list-style` image properties

- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent

- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS

- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive

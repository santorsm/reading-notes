# Functional Programming

A programming paradigm
treats computation as the evaluation of mathmatical functions
avoids changing-state and mutable data

## Pure Functions

- The returned value of a call is determined entirely by the arguments with which it is called
- The function doesn't modify any non-local state
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
- impure function - uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function
 - reading files and random number generation
 - observable side effects include - modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference

 ### Pure functions benefits

 - easier to understand and test
 - function is isolated and cannot impact other part of system

## Immutability

- state cannot be changed after its created
- to change create a new object with a anew value
- with *recursion* we keep variables immutable

## Higher-order functions

- takes one or more functions as arguments, or
- returns a function as a result

**pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency**

## Node JS

- modules - another javascript file
  - mechanisms for splitting JavaScript programs up into separate modules that can be imported when needed
  - set `module.export` equal to whatever we want to be available outside of this module
- `require` - it's a built-in function with a special purpose: to load modules
- In Node.js, each module has its own scope
- A module cannot directly access things defined in another module unless it chooses to expose them
- To expose things from a module, they must be assigned to `exports` or `module.exports`. For a module to access another module's `exports` or `module.exports`, it must use `require()`
- `require()`, `module.exports` and `exports` are APIs of a module system that is specific to Node.js 
  - Browsers do not implement this module system.
- `npm install` is a command that lets you download packages from their repository
- The npm cli puts all the downloaded modules in a `node_modules` directory where you ran `npm install`

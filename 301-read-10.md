# The JavaScript Call Stack - What It Is and Why It's Necessary

- clarity to how “function hierarchy and execution order” works in JavaScript
- the call stack is **synchronous**
- primarily used for function invocation (call)
- single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom

### what is the call stack?

- a data structure that uses the *Last In, First Out (LIFO)* principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call)
- the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns
- When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a stack frame
- stack frame is a memory location in the stack
- memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack
- The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame. It knows the next function to be executed (and will remove it after execution). This is what makes code execution in JavaScript synchronous

### What causes a stack overflow?

- when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point

### Summary

The key takeaways from the call stack are:

1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

## Types of error messages

### Reference errors

- when you try to use a variable not yet declared
- also a common thing when using `const` and `let`
  - they are hoisted *but* there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs (Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ))

`console.log(foo) // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined`

`foo = 'Hello' // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
let foo`

### Syntax errors

- this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax
  - This can be solved by just fixing the syntax

### Range errors

- manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length

### Type errors

- show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable

## Debugging

- the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply `console.log()` the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code
- The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break

## Call stack

- the path that your program has taken to reach the point were you set a breaking point or were you have an error

## Handling errors

- we usually `try` to `catch` the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application in case of an error
  - send it to a error logging to be checked later and send a fallback to the function so that our code continues without problems

  ```js
  (function testing(){
  function add(a, b) {
    try {
      var result = a + b
      return result.split('')
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('add went wrong ->', error)
      return [] // default value
    }
  }
  var stringResult = add("1", "2")
  var numberResult = add(1, 2)
  })()```

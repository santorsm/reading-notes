# List Comprehension

- always returns a list

if you used to do it like this:

new_list = []
for i in old_list:
if filter(i):
new_list.append(expressions(i))

using list comprehension, it turns to:

'new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]'

## Syntax

- starts with '[]' square brackets as the result is going to be a _list_
- then '[ expression for item in list if conditional ]'
  - same as:
    ''
    for item in list:
    if conditional:
    expression
    ''
- the breakdown:

  'new_list' = The new list (result)
  'expression(i)' = Expression is based on the variable used for each element in the old list
  'for i in old_list' = The word for followed by the variable name to use, followed by the word in the
  old list
  'if filter(i)' = Apply a filter with an If-statement

and again:

new*range = [i * i for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0] corresponds to \_result* = [*transform\* _iteration_ _filter_ ]

### Creating a list

```python
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x
```

### Create a list using loops and list comprehension

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

### Multiplying parts of a list

```python
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1]
```

### Show the first letter of each word

```python
items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]
```

### Lower/Upper case converter

```python
[x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]]
```

### Print numbers only from a given string

```python
numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()]
```

### Using list comprehension in functions

```python
def double(x):
return x\*2

[double(x) for x in range(10)]
```

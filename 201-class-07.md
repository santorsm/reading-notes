# Domain Modeling

- the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem
- describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain
- **object-oriented** - entity that stores data in properties
- uses methods to encapsulate behaviors

## Model Epic Fail videos

- determined the *two essential* metrics for popularity --> animals (Y/N)
- modeling *many* types of videos so build self-contained objects with **the same attributes & behaviors**
--> this results in small & targeted algorithm changes

## Define constructor & initialize properties

**Constructor function** defines same properties between many objects

- summary of JS representation of `EpicFailVideo`:
  - **property** `epicRating`
  - **data** 1 -10
  - **type** number

```javascript
var EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, has animals) {
  this.epicRating = epicRating;
  this.hasAnimals;
}

var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
var corgiFail(4, true)

console.log(parkourFail);
console.log(corgiFail);
}
```

## Summary

tips to follow when building your own domain models:

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors

2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties

3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well

4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside

5. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside

## In Tests We Trust — TDD with Python

- Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code
- Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think (and write!) tests first
- **Test Name** - considered as your alive documentation

  - be descriptive about it and to say what is expected and what we are testing
  - `def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():`
  - The test file name should follow the same name of module name i.e. module:`gender.py` test name: `test_gender.py`

  ```css
    mymodule/
    — module.py
    — another_folder/
    — — another_module.py
    tests/
    — test_module.py
    — another_folder/
    — — test_another_module.py
  ```

  Structure is another thing to care about

  - **Arrange, Act, and Assert**
    - **Arrange** - you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input)
    - **Act** - here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour)
    - **Assert** - after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting
  - suggest the lib `pytest`

  The Cycle is made by three steps:

  - Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
  - Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
  - Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one (don’t be shy)

  - We just need to write the method that returns the right answer

  ```python
  def run(self, name):
    return 'female'
  ```

- think about our software design first
- grow our software design consciously and well building what is needed to make the test pass
- Writing tests forces us to think about the design first and how we can break it into small pieces

identify male names:

```python
def test_should_return_male_when_the_name_is_from_male_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(‘Pedro’)
    assert expected_gender == ‘male’
```

- when we run it will fail because we just return `female`
- the fix updates our original code

```python
import requests

def run(self, name):
    result = requests.get('https://api.genderize.io/?name{}'
.format(name))
    return result['gender']

```

- other scenarios include empty name, API exceptions

_Takeaways:_

1. The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first
2. Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace
3. Beginning may be hard — and that’s fine. You just need to practice!

## What on Earth is Recursion?

- I found the stack to be very helpful in gaining a better grasp of recursion and how it works

  - main program requests answer to 4!
  - add stack frames, another whole area of the stack, on top of main
    - each for 4!, 3!, 2!, 1
    - each with own local variables with each instance of n
  - pending multipliers
    - 3! = 3 \* 2! (delivered from the previous stack)
    - where does that need to be delivered back to
      -final pending multiplier
  - each pending multiplier is holding onto a different value of n
  - the answers cascade adrop out of the bottom in the main program

## Concepts of Functional Programming

- Make software less complex
- Build side-effect-free functions.

### Functional programming

- Building the structure and elements of a program that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

### Pure functions

- A function always returns the same result if gent the same arguments - deterministic
  - No external objects
- No observable side effects.  
  - Any function that relies on a random number generator cannot be pure *but* it will not cause any *observable side effects*.
    - Mutability is discouraged

### Benefits

- Easier to test code

### Immutability

- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed
  - Use `forEach` since it does not change the original array

### Referential transparency

- The same input always gives the same output
- pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

### Functions as first-class entities

- treated as values and used as data
- They can:
  - refer to it from constants and variables
  - pass it as a parameter to other functions
    - return it as result from other functions

### Higher-order functions

- takes 1+ functions as arguments
- returns a function as its result

### Filter

- Imperative approach
  - not functional programming
- Declarative approach
  - more functional

### Map

- creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element
- calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order
- does not change the original array

### Reduce

- reduces the array to a single value
- executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right)
  - return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total)
- does not change the original array

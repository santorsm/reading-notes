- provides a definition of a 'resource'
- a web page is a representation of a resource
- need a way to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines
- URLs - how the machines tell each other where things are
  - common language that let all the disparate systems talk to one another
- Universal verbs like PUT, GET, and DELETE
- HTTP is all about typing verbs and nouns
- the important thing is that different kinds of nouns can be treated the same
  - you can GET all different things the same way

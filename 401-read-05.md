# Linked Lists

## What is a Linked List

A _Linked List_ is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other

- two types - Singly and Doubly

**Node** - contains a value and a reference to the next node in the link

**Singly**:

- number of references to the node
- single reference pointing to the next node in the linked list

**Doubly**:

- two (double) references within the node
- reference to both the Next and Previous node

**Head**:

- the name of the first node in the linked list

## Traversal

- nodes do not know the total # of nodes in the linked list
- not as easy as running a for loop
- depend on the _next_ value to guide
- `while` loop more effective
  - continually check for a value in the next node
  - current node where we are in the linked list
  - reaching the node with a `null` value with trigger the end of the loop

## Insertions

- be cognizant of the Big O associated with the position you are looking to insert the value
- a significant difference between inserting at the beginning v at a particular position in the linked list
- inserting at the head: independent of the size of the list O(1)
- inserting at the end or in the middle: completely dependent on the size of the list, Big O(n)

## Features

- arrays - static data structure
  - always needs a given size and amount of memory
  - allocate memory when created
- linked list - dynamic data structure
  - size, shape, and memory can change

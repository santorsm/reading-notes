# Class 2 Notes

## HTML Chap 2
### Text

HTML elements describe the structure of the page
- also provide semantic information
  - where emphasis placed
  - definition of acronyms

What's the difference between **structural** and **semantic** markups?
- **structural** describe headings & paragraphs, the pyhiscal structure of the page. while **semantic** provides *extra* information is where emphais is placed in a sentence
- **structural** : 
  - Headings `<h1>`...`<h6>`
  - Paragraphs `<p></p>`
  - bold `<b></b>`: characters appear **bold**
    - visually different - does not imply any add'l meaning
  - italics `<i></i>`: represent a section of text that would be *said* in a different way from surrounding content
    - ie technical terms, foreign words, thoughts

- **superscript**: `<sup></sup>`
- **subscript**: `<sub</sub>>`

- **White** **space** **collapsing**: indent code to make easier to read but will render as normal to viewer of webpage

- **line** **breaks**: `<br />` adds a line break inside the middle of the paragraph

- **horizontal** **breaks**: `<hr />` create a break between themes
  - changes of topic in a book or theme in a play
- **semantic** : text elements not intended to affect the structure of webpages
  - add extra infomation to the pages
  - should not be used to change the way the text looks
  - purpose is to dexcribe the *content* of the web page more accurately
    - screenreaders or search engines

What are some examples of semantic markup?

**strong** : `<strong>`: content has strong importance - might be said with strong emphasis - default shown in **bold*
**emphasis** : emphasis that subtly changes meaning
  - default shown in *italics*

**quotations**: 
- `<blockquote>`: for longer quotes that take up entire paragraph
- `<q>`: for shorter quotes w/in paragraph

**Abbreviations** **&** **Acronyms**:`<abbr>`: a title attribute on the opening tag used to specify full term

**Citations** **&** **Definitions**: 
- `<cite>`- referenceing piece of work such as a book, research paper - indicates where citation is from 
- rendered in *italics*
- `<dfn>` - the first time a terminology is used

**Author** **details**: `<address>`: contact info for the author of the page
**Changes** **to** **Content**
`<ins>`: content has been inserted, usually underlined
`<del>`: content deleted, usually has line through it
`<s>`: something no loger accruate or relevant (but not deleted), lined through


## CSS Chap 10
### Introducing CSS

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box
  - uses rules to indicate how that element should look
- Rules = **selectors** - specify the elements the rule applies to
  - **declarations** - what these eklements should look like
- Different types of selectors allow targeting of differnet elements
- **Declarations** = two parts: 
  - the **properties** of the element that you want to change
  - the **values** of those properties
    -  ex, the *font-family* property sets the choice of font, and the value *arial* specifies Arial as the preferred typeface
- CSS usually in a separate document

What's the best way to understand how CSS works?

**Answer**: imagine ther is an invisible box around every HTML element. CSS allows the creation of of rules that control the way each individual box (and the content of that box) is presented

- **Block** **level** **elements** look like they start on a new line. Examples include the `<h1>`- `<h6>`, `<p>` and `<div>` elements
- **Inline** **elements** flow within the text and do not start on a new line. Examples include `<b>`, `<i>`, `<img>`, `<em>` and `<span>`

### Example Styles

**Boxes**: 
- Widith & height
- Borders: color, width, and size
- Background colors and images
- Position in the browser window

**Text**:
- Typeface
- Size
- Color
- Italics, bold, cases

**Specific**:
- style certain elements such as lists, tables, and forms

How does CSS work?
- it associates rules with HTML elements
- these rules govern how the specified elements should be displayed

Some facts on **selectors**:
- indicate which element the rule applies to 
- same rule can apply to multiple elements if eleements separated with commas

### Using External CSS

`<link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" 
    rel="stylesheet" />`
- inside `<head>` tag
- tells HTML where to look
- the details:
  - `href` - specifies path to the CSS file
  - `type` - specifies type of file
  - `rel` - specifies relationship between HTML & file
    - `stylesheet` for CSS
- HTML can use multiple CSS files
  - `<link>`to each CSS - one CSS to control presentation another for layout

### Using Internal CSS
- `<style>`element usually sits inside the `<head>`
- should use the `type` attribute to indicate CSS

### CSS Selectors
- manytypes of CS selectors
- reference pg 238

### How CSS rules Cascade - understanding precedence

**Last** **ruLe**
- two identical selectors
- the *latter* of the two will take precedence

**Specificity**
- one selector is more specific than the others, the more *specific* rule will take precedence over more *general* 

**Inheritance**: 
- `<body>` `font-family` apply to most child elements
- a lot of elements can be forced by using `inherit`

What are sopme advantages of using separate CSS sheets?
1. same code does not need to be repeated in every page (which results in less code and smaller HTML pages)
2. once the user has downloaded the CSS stylesheet, the rest of the site will load faster
3. only need to edit the one CSS file and all of your pages will be updated

When would you consider placing CSS on same sheet as HTML?
1. just creating a single page - everything in one place
2. one page which requires a few extra rules (that are not used by the rest of the site), might consider using CSS in the same page

**BUT** most authors consider CSS on separate file as **best** **practice**


## JS Chap 2
### Basic Javascript

**statement** - each individual instruction or step

### Let's talk about variables

What is a variable? <hr />
**variable** - where a script temporarily stores bits of information it needs to do its job <hr />
What do we have to do to use them?
1. announce that you want to use it
- creating the variable & giving it a name
- example: `var quantity;`
  - if more than one word written in **camelCase**

2. Tell the variable info you'd like it to store or *assign* *a* *value* to it
- example `quantity = 3;`

var price =5;
var quantity = 14;
var total = price * quantity

var price, quantity, total;
proce = 5;
quantity = 14; 
total = price * quantity;

What types of data cab be stored in variables in JavaScript?
1. Numeric
2. String
3. Boolean

### Arrays
- a list or set of values that are related to each other
- especially helpful when the list length is unknown
  - don't need to specify how many values the array will hold
  - can be different data types - can store a string, number, and Boolen in the same array
  - values access as if in numbered list
    - remember that the numbering starts at 0 (zero)
      - each given an **index**
      - accessed by: `colors[2]`

How do we create an array?
- not much different than creating any other variable
- example: `var colors; colors = ['white', 'black', 'custom']`
**expressions**evaluates into a single value
- rely on **operators** that allow a single value to be created from multiple
- types: 
1. assignment (=)
2. arithmetic (*, +), pg 76
3. string
4. comparison (>, <>)
5. Logical (&&) 

## JS Chap 4
### Decision Loops
- 2 components to a decision:
  1. expression ie evaluated, which reurns a value
  2. a conditional statementsays what to do in a given situation

### Comparison operators
- `==` is equal to 
  - compares two values (numbers, strins, or Booleans) to see if they are the same
- `!=` is not equal to
  - compares two values (numbers, strins, or Booleans) to see if they are *not* the same
- `===`strict equal to
  - compares two values to check that both the data type **and** values are the same
- `!==`strict not equal to
  - compares two values to check that both the data type **and** values are the same

### Logical Operators
- `&&` - loginal and
  - tests for more than 1 condition
  - if **both** expressions are true then true, else false
- `||` - logical or
  - if **either** expressions are true then true, else false
-`!` - logical not
  - single Boolean and inverts it

### IF & IF & ELSE Statement

if (score >= 50) {
  congratulate();
}
else {
  encourage();
}

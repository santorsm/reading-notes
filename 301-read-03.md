# Readings: MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX

## Mustache

Javascript templating - fast and efficiently renders client-side view templates w/ Javascript - uses JSON data source

- HTML markup
- templating tags added
  - inserts variables
  - runs programming logic
  
- Template engine -
- replaces variables & instances declared in a template file at runtime with actual values
- converts template into HTML file sent to the client

***Mustache*** - logic-less template syntax

- ***“logic-less”***  no if statements, else clauses, or for loops
- there are only *tags*
- Used with many things HTML, config files, source code, etc.
- Expands tags in a template using values supplied in a hash or object

`mustache.js` is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript

Supports many languages, therefore we *don’t* need a separate templating system on the

## Flexbox

provides a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic

- parent element (the flex container) and the child elements (the flex items)

- main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes)
  - flex containers expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow

**Most importantly** the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (`block` which is vertically-based and `inline` which is horizontally-based)

- Both lack flexibility to handle to support complex applications
- A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow

### **Note**

***Flexbox*** layout most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts  
***Grid*** layout is intended for larger scale layouts

### Basics & Terminolgy

flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties
Some on the container (parent element, known as “flex container”) others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”)

- items are laid out following either the **main axis** or the **cross axis**:

- **main axis** – horizontal - the primary axis along which flex items are laid out.
- **main-start** | **main-end** – flex items placed within the container starting from `main-start` and going to `main-end`.
- **main size** – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size.
- **cross axis** – The axis perpendicular to the `main axis` its direction depends on the main axis direction.
- **cross-start** | **cross-end** – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
- **cross size** – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size.

### Properties of flex container

- `display`: defines the flex container - enables flex context for childres
- `flex-direction`: establishes the `main-axis` defines the direction flex items are placed - horizontal or vertical
- `flex-wrap`: default all try to fit on one line, allows them to wrap
- `flex-flow`: shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` properties
- `justify-content`: defines alignment over `main-axis`- distributes extra free space
- `align-items`: defines default behavior for how laid out along the `cross axis`  
- `align-content`: the `justify-content`for cross-axis

### Properties of flex items

- `order`: conrols the order they appear w/in container
- `flex-grow`:defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary - dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up
- `flex-shrink`:defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary
- `flex-basis`:default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed
- `flex`: shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` combined - **It is recommended that you use this shorthand property**
- `align-self`: allows overrides default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) for individual flex items

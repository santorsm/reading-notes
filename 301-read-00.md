# ES6 classes

## Inheritance

When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: `objects`

JavaScript objects use prototype-based inheritance

JavaScript objects are dynamic "bags" of properties

It can be loosely described by saying that when methods or properties are attached to object’s prototype they become available for use on that object and its descendants, but not directly attached to them.

Calling a function with the new operator returns an object that is an instance of the function

## this

A function's this keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages

It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode

When a function is used as a constructor (with the new keyword), its this is bound to the new object being constructed

## Classes

Classes are a template for creating objects

They encapsulate data with code to work on that data

One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a class, you use the `class` keyword with the name of the class

An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted and class declarations are not

You first need to declare your class and then access it, otherwise code like the following will throw a `ReferenceError`

When you use `class` and `extends` keywords internally JavaScript will still use prototype-based inheritance

It just simplifies the syntax (this is often called “Syntactic Sugar”)

## Difference from Prototypal Inheritance

`function()` becomes `class {}`
`call()` becomes `extends`

- Classes are standalone, self-contained object (instance) factories
- Ultimately, they result in a prototype
- But for the developer, they are many orders of magnitude easier to comprehend and work with

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name  = name;
  }

  walk() {}
}

// Thanks to 'extends', all birds can now do all things animals can
class Bird extends Animal {
  // Birds can walk, becuase they're animals also do their own thing.
  fly() {}
}

// Make one (the same was as before, but wasn't the class creation much easier?)
let parrot = new Bird('parrot');
parrot.fly();
parrot.walk();
```

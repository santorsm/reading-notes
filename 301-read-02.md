## State and Props

### State and Lifecycle

- similar to props
- provate & fully controlled by the component

### Converting a Function to a Class

Convert a function component like `Clock` to a class in these steps:

1. Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends `React.Component`
2. Add a single empty method to it called `render()`
3. Move the body of the function into the `render()` method
4. Replace props with `this.props` in the `render()` body

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

- the render method will be called each time an update happens
- as long as we render <Clock /> into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used

### Adding Local State to a Class

- Replace `this.props.date` with `this.state.date` in the `render()` method:

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

- Add a class constructor that assigns the initial `this.state`:

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

- Note how we pass `props` to the base constructor

```jsx
constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }
  ```

- Class components should always call the base constructor with `props`

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class

- it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed
  - "mounting" - set up whenever rendered to DOM for the first time
  - "unmounting" - clear whenever the DOM is removed

### Using State Correctly

- 3 things to know about `setState()`
  1. **Do Not Modify State Drectly**

    ```jsx
    // Wrong
    this.state.comment = 'Hello';
    ```

    use `setState()`:

    ```jsx
    // Correct
    this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
    ```

    The *only* place where you can assign `this.state` is the **constructor**

  2. **State Updates May Be Asynchronous**

    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance

    Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you *should not* rely on their values for calculating the next state

    use a second form of `setState()` that accepts a function rather than an object

    1st argument - the previous state 
    2nd argument - the props at the time the update

    ```jsx
    // Correct
    this.setState((state, props) => ({
      counter: state.counter + props.increment
    }));
    ```

### State Updates are Merged

  call `setState()`, React merges the object you provide into the current state

  your state may contain several independent variables:

  ```jsx
  constructor(props) {
  super(props);
    this.state = {
      posts: [],
      comments: []
    };
  }
  ```

  Update independently with separate `setState()` calls:

    ```jsx
    componentDidMount() {
      fetchPosts().then(response => {
        this.setState({
          posts: response.posts
        });
      });

      fetchComments().then(response => {
        this.setState({
          comments: response.comments
        });
      });
    }
    ```

### The Data Flows Down

  Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless

  don't care whether it is defined as a function or a class

  state is often called *local or encapsulated*
  
  It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it

  Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components “below” them in the tree

  Imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component’s state is like an additional water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down

  Stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time

## Handling Events

  React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase

  With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string

  <button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
  </button>

### Passing Arguments to Event Handlers


<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>


## Conditional Rendering

create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need

render only some of them, depending on the state of your application

works the same way conditions work in JavaScript

Use JavaScript operators like `if` or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them

# Responsive Web Design (RWD) and Floats

## Intro to RWD

How to build websites suitable for all users

- A dense read, with detailed info - best attempt to synthsize

- the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop
  - coined by Ethan Marcotte

- 3 main concepts:
  - flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media
    1. **flexible layout** - practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width
    - built with relativ unit length - used to declare common grid properties of *width, margin, or padding*
      - they **do not** advocate the use fixed pixels
      - take tgt width of an element and dividing it bythe width of its parent element

        ```html
        target ÷ context = result
        ```

      - no matter how wide the parent `container` becomes, the `section` and `aside` margins and widths scale proportionally
    2. **Media Queries** - provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example
    - ability to apply *targeted styles*
      - multiple ways to use:
        - using the `@media` rule inside of an existing style sheet
        - importing a new stylesheet using the `@import` rule
        - or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document
    **Recommendation** - use the `@media` rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests
    - Each media query may include a media type followed by one or more expressions
      - Common media types include `all, screen, print, tv, and braille`
        - if not specified `screen`
    - Can be used in conjunction with logical operators
    - One of most common media features revolve around `height & width`
    - Other Media Features in Media Queries
      - Orientation
      - Apect Ratio
      - Resolution
      - Mobile First - using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows
        - viewport

  3. **Flexible Media** - As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes
      - use `max-width` with a value of 100%
      - Ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width

## All about Floats

**Float** is a CSS positioning property

- elements with the CSS `float` property applied to them are just like the images in the print layout where the text flows around them
  - Floated elements *remain a part of the flow of the web page*
  - **Absolutely** positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage, like when the text box in the print layout was told to ignore the page wrap
  - will not interact with  the position of other elements
  - 4 values: `Left, Right, None, & Inherit`

### What are Floats used for?

- can be used to create entire web layouts
  - **Note** - stronger layout tools *but* float has some unique abilities
  - helpful for image changes size the text in the box will reflow to accommodate

### Clearing the Float

  `clear` - element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float

### The Great Collapse

- If the parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing
  - collapsing almost always needs to be dealt with
  - `clear` the float **after** the floated elements *in* the container
  - but **before** the close of the container

### Techniques for Clearing Floats

- The ideal solution - If you are in a situation where you always know what the succeeding element is going to be, you can apply the `clear: both;` to that element and be done
  - unfortunately things seldom work out that way, requiring other tools
    - **the empty div method** -

    ```html
    <div style="clear: both;"></div>
    ```

    - div is the most common because it has no browser default styling, doesn’t have any special function, and is unlikely to be generically styled with CSS
    - **the overflow method** - setting the overflow CSS property on a parent element
    - If this property is set to auto or hidden on the parent element, the parent will expand to contain the floats, effectively clearing it for succeeding elements
      - the overflow property isn’t specifically for clearing floats
    - **the easy clearing method** - uses a clever CSS pseudo selector `(:after)` to clear floats
    - add'l code req'd for older browsers

### Problems w/Floats

  1. Pushdown
    - *Quick fix*: Make sure you don’t have any images that do this, use overflow: hidden to cut off excess

  2. Double Margin Bug
    - *Quick fix*: set display: inline on the float, and don’t worry it will remain a block-level element
  3. 3px Jog
    - *Quick fix*: set a width or height on the affected text
  4. Bottom Margin Bug
    - *Quick fix*: using bottom padding on the parent instead

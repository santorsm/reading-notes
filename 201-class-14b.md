## [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

- analyzing and improving individual workers isn’t enough
- increasingly global and complex, the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based
- If a company wants to outstrip its competitors, it needs to influence not only how people work but also how they work together
- Google *Project Aristotle* why some teams stumbled and others soared
- found almost no patterns
- group norms
  - behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather
    - group norms tend to override individual procliviites
- Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams
  - but which one's mattered most?

- **how team members treated one another**

- two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared

  1. on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’
  2. the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues

- Team A may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. But the group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid
  - There’s a good chance the members of Team A will continue to act like individuals once they come together

- psychological safety — defines as a ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’
  - interpersonal trust and mutual respect

- In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs

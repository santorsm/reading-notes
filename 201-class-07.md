# Domain Modeling

- the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem
- describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain
- **object-oriented** - entity that stores data in properties
- uses methods to encapsulate behaviors

## Model Epic Fail videos

- determined the *two essential* metrics for popularity --> animals (Y/N)
- modeling *many* types of videos so build self-contained objects with **the same attributes & behaviors**
--> this results in small & targeted algorithm changes

## Define constructor & initialize properties

**Constructor function** defines same properties between many objects

- summary of JS representation of `EpicFailVideo`:
  - **property** `epicRating`
  - **data** 1 -10
  - **type** number

```javascript
var EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, has animals) {
  this.epicRating = epicRating;
  this.hasAnimals;
}

var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
var corgiFail(4, true)

console.log(parkourFail);
console.log(corgiFail);
}
```

## Summary

tips to follow when building your own domain models:

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors

2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties

3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well

4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside

5. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside

# Functions, Methods & Objects

used to orgnize code

## Functions

- group a set of related statements together
- represent a single task
- pieces of information passed to a function are known as **parameters** - info to do their job - and return a value

- **Declaring a Function**
  - must start with the word *function* and followed by function name `sayHello()`
  - code block surrounded by `{}`
- must be **called** by `sayHello();`
- for function that need information
  - indicate what it needs to know in the prentheses father the function name:
    `function getArea(width, height)`
    - these are *parameters* inside they are variables
    - to call this function `getArea(3, 5);`
      - the values passed into the code are called *arguments*

## Variable Scope

- the *location* of where the variable is declared will affect where it can be used within your code
  
### Local Variables

- if declared within can only be used w/in that function
  - using the `var` keyword
- function runs twice & cn have different value each time
- Two different functions can use variables with the same name w/o any kind of naming conflict

### Global Variables

- if created *outside* function; the variable can be used anywhere w/in the script
- stored in memory for as long as the web page is loaded in the web browser
- cons: take up more memory and greater chance of naming conflicts
- due to this ---> use *local variables*
- if `var` is not used when decalring a function, it will work but it will be trated as a *global variable*

## Objects

- a series of variables and functions that represent something existing in the world
- within and object:
    *variables* = **properties**
    *functions* = **methods**
- web browsers implement objectsthat represent both the browser window & the document loaded into the browser
- JS has several built-in objects such as `String` `Number` `Math` `Date`
  - their properties offer functionality
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets
  both can contain the other
- object constructor:
  - The function can be used to create multiple objects
- The `this` keyword is used instead of the object name

function `Hotel(name, rooms, booked)` { this.name = name;
this.rooms = rooms;
this.booked = booked;
this.checkAvailability = ...

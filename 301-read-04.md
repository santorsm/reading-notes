# Forms

- HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state
- *controlled components* - a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form

## Controlled Components

HTML v React:

- In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input
- In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with `setState()`
- We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”
  - the React component that *renders* a form *also* controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input
- With a controlled component, the input’s value is **always** driven by the React state
- While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers

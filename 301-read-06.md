# An Introduction to Node JS

## Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

- This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers
- It’s a JavaScript runtime
- You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing `node -v`
- Next, create a new file `hello.js` and copy in the following code:
  ```js
  console.log("Hello, World!");
  ```
- This uses Node’s built-in console module to display a message in a terminal window
- To run the example, enter the following command:
  `node hello.js`

## Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager

- In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry
- There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week
- installing a package globally: `npm install -g jshint`
- installing a package locally: `npm init -y`
  - install to a project

## Working with the package.json File

- `node_modules` folder shouldn’t be checked in to version control, and can, in fact, be re-created at any time by running `npm install` from within the project’s root

## What Is Node.js Used For?

- frameworks (and many, many related packages) are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run
  - [The Anatomy of a Modern JavaScript Application](https://www.sitepoint.com/anatomy-of-a-modern-javascript-application/)
- one of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server
- Node uses the `libuv` library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior
- single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event
- Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections
- The traditional approach to scaling a Node app is to clone it and have the cloned instances share the workload
  - [What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)
- there are some downsides:
  - single thread does impose some limitations - For example, blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process
  - some dislike the callback-based style of coding that JavaScript imposes

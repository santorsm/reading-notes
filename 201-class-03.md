# Class 3 Notes

## HTML Lists

### *Why does HTML provide the ability to use lists?*
- There are many occassions when we'd need to use lists

### *What types of lists does HTML provide?*

1. **Ordered** **lists**: each item in list is numbered
2. **Unordered** **lists**: begin with bullet
3. **Definition** **lists**: set of terms with defintions

### *How does implement these lists in their HTML?*

**Ordered** **lists**:
- created with `<ol>` element
- each item placed btwn `<li>` & `</li>`
  - list item

**Unordered** **lists**:
- created with `<ul>` element
- each item placed btwn `<li>` & `</li>`
  - list item

**Definiton** **lists**:
- created with `<dl>` element
- pairs of `<dt>`- definition term
& `<dd>` - its definition

### NOTE: you can put a 2nd list inside an `<li>` element for a Nested list

## HTML Boxes

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box
  - use CSS to control dimensions of a box

### `width` & `height`:
- in percentages, pixels, or ems
- traditionally pixels - more accurate
- % is the size of browser window or % of the size of the containing box
- ems - size of the containing box
- overflow - what to do if content is bigger then box
  - hidden or flow

### Border, Margin & Padding & how best to remeber?

  - Let's work from out to in:
    - **M**argin - set width of margin to create a gap btwn the borders of adjacent boxes
    - **Bo**rder 
    - **P**adding - between the border of a box and any content within it
      - adding padding can increase readability
  - **MBoP**
  - specify the width of a box - the MBoP are added to to the width & height
  - padding & margin properties helpful in *adding space* between items on the page 

### What options are available for the Border Padding and Margin?
- Border
  - `Border-width`
  - `Border-style`
  - `Border-color`
    - *All* included in the `border` property `Border: width style color;` (3px dotted #0088dd;)

- Padding
  - most often in pixels `px`
  - shorthand **clockwise from top**
    `padding: 10px 5px 3px 1px`;
    - top -> right -> bottom -> left

- Margin
- most often in pixels `px`
  - shorthand **clockwise from top**
    `margin: 10px 5px 3px 1px`;
    - top -> right -> bottom -> left

### Centering
 - set left and right maring to `auto`
 - `text-align` is **inherited** by child elements

 ### How do we handle/change inline & block
 - use the `display` property to turn inline -> block or block -> inline

### How about hiding things?
- `visibility` hides boxes and *leaves a space where the element would have been*

  

## JS Chap 4
### IF...ELSE v SWITCH
- Ifs are *all* checked *even if* a match has been found
  - **slower** than a SWITCH
- SWITCH
  - there's a **default** option
  - if match found then a **break** statement stops the rest of the switch statement from running
    - better perf than multipl IF statements
    - pg 165

### Type coercion
- JS can convert data types to complete an operation
  - weak typing v strong typing b/c data type for a value can change
- can lead to unexpected values
- **checking two equals better to use strict equal `===` as these check that *value* and *data type* match
- b/c of this type coercion every value in JS can be treated as if it were true or False

### Falsy
- treated as *if* they are false <br />
- can also be treated a number 0
-> `false, 0, NaN, Empty, no value assigned`
### Truthy
- treated as if they are true
- can also be treated a number 1
  - almost everything that is not in the falsey <br />
  -> `true, 1, strings w/content, number calcs, zero (0) as string, 'false' as a string`

- b/c of this can be use to check wquality & existence 
  - pg 168
- processed L -> R
 - short circuit (stop) as soon as result found

## Loops
- `FOR`: run code for a specific # of times
  - usually acounter
- `WHILE`: when you don't know how many times to run
  - can be something other than a counter
  - code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true
- `DO WHILE`: will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once
  - even if conditions evaluate to `false`

  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    document.write(i);
  }
    - initialization: var i = 0
    - condition: i < 10
    - update: i++

  while (i < 10) {
    msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br />';
    i++;
  }
    - `+=` :shorthand for writing: msg =msg + 'newmsg'

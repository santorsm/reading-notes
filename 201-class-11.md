## Images

### Controlling Size

- use width and height properties in CSS as you would for any box
  - specifying size helps page load more smoothly
  - determine size of images used commonly throughout the site
  - give each size a name
  (eg *small, medium, large*)
  - use thse names as values for the class attribute
  - add selectors in CSS for each class name and use `width` and `height`
  properties to control

### Alignment

- `float` property to align
- two ways this is achieved:
  1. The `float `property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image (such as the small class in our example)

  2. New classes are created with names such as `align-left` or `align-right` to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image

- common to add a margin to the image to ensure text deos not touch image

### Centering

- images are inline elements by default
  - ie they float w/in surrounding text
- to center must change from inline ----> block
- After changed to block-level property, two ways to horizontally center an image

  1. On the containing element, you can use the `text-align` property with a value of center

  2. On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto

- can specify class-names that allow any element to be centered int he same way
- the techniques for specifying image size and alignment of an image can be used with the element

```HTML
<figure>
```

### Background Images

- uses `background-image` property

  - by default this image will fill entire box

  - associated property values include:

  - Repeating images:
    - `background-repeat`
    - `background-attachment`

  - Positioning
    - `background-position`
      - examples include: `left top`, `right top`, `center center`
 
    - Can also use pair of pixels or percentages represent distance from *top left* corner of browser window (or containing box)

      - top left corner is equal to 0% 0%

      - 50% 50% centers the image horizontally and vertically
  
  - Shorthand
    - `background` property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties including `background-color`

    - The properties **must** be specified in the following order, but you can exclude any value if you do not want to specify it.
      1. background-color
      2. background-image
      3. background-repeat
      4. background-attachment
      5. background-position

  - Image rollovers & Gradients

    - can create link or button that changes to second style when user moves mouse over it (aka rollover) and a third when clicked

    - use sprites to reduce the # of images the browser has to load

    - can specify the gradient for the background of a box

  - Contrast of Background Images

    - To overlay text on an image with high contrast, you can place a semi-transparent background color (or "screen") behind the text to improve legibility


## Practical Information

- Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

  - At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in their results

  - They also consider how many sites link to you (and how relevant those links are)

  - SEO
is often split into two areas: *on-page techniques* and *off-page techniques*

    - On-Page techniques
      - keywords people likely to search for include in text
      - have appropriate text in `alt` attribute
    
    - Off-Page techniques
      - getting other *relevant* sites to link to you
      - also look between the `<a>` `</a>` for keywords
      - these words should also appear inthe text of the page

    - 7 key places where keywords can appear to improve its findabiity
      1. Page title
      2. url / WeB address
      3. headings
      4. text
      5: link text
      6: image alt text
      7: Page descriPtions `<head>` and `meta`

## Audio & video

- The `<video>` and `<audio>` elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages

- `controls`, which enables the default set of playback controls. If you don't specify this, you get no playback controls

- `HTMLMediaElement` API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically
  - available to both `<audio>` and `<video>` elements
  - The whole player is wrapped in a `<div>` element, so it can all be styled as one unit if needed

[dunder jupyter notebook](https://github.com/pybites/dunders/blob/master/richer-classes-with-dunders.ipynb)

- predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes
- let you emulate the behavior of built-in types

## Object Initialization: **init**

- the constructor needed to construct objects
- takes care of setting up the object

```python
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []
```

- allows us to create new accounts like this:

```python
>>> acc = Account('bob')  # default amount = 0
>>> acc = Account('bob', 10)
```

## Object Representation: **str**, **repr**

- provide a string representation of your object for the consumer of your class (a bit like API documentation)
- two ways to do this using dunder methods:

**repr**: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of **repr** is to be unambiguous

**str**: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser

```python
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
            self.owner, self.amount)
```

```python
>>> str(acc)
'Account of bob with starting amount: 10'

>>> print(acc)
"Account of bob with starting amount: 10"

>>> repr(acc)
"Account('bob', 10)"
```

## Iteration: **len**, **getitem**, **reversed**

```python
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._transactions)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._transactions[position]
```

```python
>>> len(acc)
5

>>> for t in acc:
...    print(t)
20
-10
50
-20
30

>>> acc[1]
-10
```

## Statistics

[Tutorial: Basic Statistics in Python — Probability](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/)

- seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?”
- use statistics to calculate probabilities based on observations from the real world and check how it compares to the ideal

### From statistics to probability

- Our data point will be the number of heads we observe
- If we perform many, many trials, we expect the average number of heads over all of our trials to approach the 50%
- Probability provides the theory, while statistics provides the tools to test that theory using data
- The descriptive statistics, specifically mean and standard deviation, become the proxies for the theoretical

### The data and the distribution

- Before we can tackle the question of “which wine is better than average,” we have to mind the nature of our data
- The most important qualities to notice about the normal distribution is its symmetry and its shape
- In a probability context, the high point in a normal distribution represents the event with the highest probability of occurring

**Central Limit Theorem** - lets us know that the average of many trials means will approach the true mean

**Three Sigma Rule** - also known as the empirical rule or 68-95-99.7 rule

- an expression of how many of our observations fall within a certain distance of the mean
- dictates that given a normal distribution, 68% of your observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean. 95% will fall within two, and 99.7% will fall within three

### Z-score

- (data - mean)/standard dev
- The cumulative probability is the sum of the probabilities of all values occurring, up until a given point
- the sum of all probabilities must equal 100%, so we can use the Z-table to calculate probabilities on both sides of the Z-score under the normal distribution
